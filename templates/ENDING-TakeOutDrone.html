        <p class="stinfo">{{NAME}} is thankful they remembered about their drone when getting ready this morning!
            {{NAME}} places it on the ground, and it spins to life, catching the attention of everyone there. {{NAME}}'s
            mother, however, starts to yell and scream at the uprising of Chinese technology in her household. {{NAME}}
            ended up taking many drone shots of the family, where {{NAME}} charged them a pricy amount for access to
            them. Another day for business.</p>
