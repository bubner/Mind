        <p class="stinfo">{{NAME}} decides to be stubborn and play an old game. It's a classic and quite old, but it's still a lot of fun for {{NAME}}. {{NAME}} knows they have to go to their mother's tomorrow, and they stop playing to get some sleep. <br> <br> Tomorrow comes. {{NAME}} hastily grabs a bag of chips for the way, not checking what was actually in the bag. {{NAME}} goes to their mother's house and stands there in the corner while everyone gets along. {{NAME}} overheard someone talk about the new game they played. What does {{NAME}} do?</p>
