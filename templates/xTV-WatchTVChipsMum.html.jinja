            tomorrow. How boring. {{NAME}} continues to munch on their chips and mindlessly watch the TV. {{NAME}} runs
            low on chips and saves them for tomorrow. <br> <br> Tomorrow comes, and {{NAME}} takes a bunch of stuff with
            them to their Mum's to keep them occupied. They had almost forgotten to bring their drone, but it was
            fortunately sitting right next to the bag of chips from last night. How does {{NAME}} go about impressing
            the crowds?</p>
